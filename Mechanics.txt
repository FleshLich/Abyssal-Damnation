Combo Points(3 or 5)
One hit gives one combo point
They decay quickly when not attacking
Once full, player can stun boss(guaranteed damage) or do heavy attack(lots of damage none guaranteed) -- (Calculate dps and time stunned to make sure player cant do more damage to boss than heavy attack while stunned)
Player loses points when hit

Maybe make upgrade that unlock more powers
